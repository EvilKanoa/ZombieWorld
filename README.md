# ZombieWorld
A video game developed by Kanoa and Jonathan

## Developing
To start developing on ZombieWorld, you need Gradle, a compatiple JDK, and (optionally) an IDE. We suggest using IntelliJ IDEA since it has some great built in Gradle and Kotlin support.

Start by cloning the repo using `git clone`. Then you need to download all the dependencies (including the Android libraries) which can be done by running `./gradlew assemble` (Linux/Mac) or `gradlew assemble` (Windows).

To run the code simply use `./gradlew run` (Linux/Mac) or `gradlew run` (Windows).
